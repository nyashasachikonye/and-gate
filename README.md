This project was part of a series to learn how to code in Hardware Description Languages such as VHDL and Verilog. It involves the creation of simple logic components and circuitry.

Here I demonstrate the implementation of an AND gate.

An AND gate is a digital logic gate with two or more inputs and one output that performs logical conjunction. The output of an AND gate is true only when all of the inputs are true. If one or more of an AND gate's inputs are false, then the output of the AND gate is false.

This README would normally document whatever steps are necessary to get your application up and running.
